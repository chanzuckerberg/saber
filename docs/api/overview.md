# Overview

## Introduction 

Welcome to the SABER Python API, your programmatic gateway to high-resolution segmentation in electron tomography (cryo-ET) and electron microscopy (EM). Whether you’re integrating segmentation into large-scale pipelines or building custom tools, the SABER API gives you full control.

With SABER's modular and extensible API, you can: 

* Load and manage tomographic datasets
* Interface with the Segment Anything Model (SAM2) and custom classifiers
* Apply and refine segmentations in 2D or across 3D volumes
* Save, visualize, and evaluate segmentations with ease

The API is designed for flexibility and reproducibility—ideal for researchers, developers, and power users alike.

Once you’re ready, continue to the API quickstarts:

* [Micrographs (2D) Quickstart](quickstart2d.md): Learn how to segment 2D EM images with SAM2 and SABER.
* [Volumes (3D) Quickstart](quickstart3d.md): Apply the workflow on full 3D volumes.
